Introduction to Euler$'$s number and its unique characteristics
\end{center}
\bigskip


\section*{1. INTRODUCTION}

\noindent  Euler$'$s number e is a mathematical constant which is the base of the natural logarithm. It's a unique number whose natural logarithm is equal to one. It's value is approximately 2.71828 and is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series:
$${\displaystyle e=\sum \limits _{n=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n!}}={\frac {1}{1}}+{\frac {1}{1}}+{\frac {1}{1\cdot 2}}+{\frac {1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3}}+\cdots }\displaystyl}$$

\noindent Euler$'$s number is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, number e is also known as Napier's constant

\section*{2. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS}
\noindent 1) e can be defined as a unique positive number $'$a$'$ such that the graph of the function y=ax has unit slope at x = 0.[3] The function f(x) = ex is called the (natural) exponential function, and is the unique exponential function equal to its own derivative.\newline
\noindent 2) There is the remarkable property that if the function $e^ x$ (known as the exponential function and also denoted as "$\exp (x) $") is differentiated with respect to $x$, then the result is the same function $e^ x$

\section*{3. APPLICATIONS}
\noindent 1) Compound Interest: The usage of this constant in compound interest was discovered by James Bernoulli in 1683.Bernoulli noticed that an account that would start with 1\$ with interest rate R will yield eRt dollars after t years with continuous compounding.\newline
\noindent 2) Derangements: Discovered by  Pierre Raymond de Montmort and Bernoulli , e could be applied in  derangements. A derangement is a permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.\newline
\noindent 3) Standard normal distribution: The normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation is known as the standard normal distribution, given by the probability density function

{\displaystyle \phi (x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}}.} {\displaystyle \phi (x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}e^{-{\frac {1}{2}}x^{2}}.}
